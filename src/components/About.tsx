    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 font-normal">
      Life as a young person brings unique challengesâ€”from school pressures to social media stress and beyond. At MindBloom, we believe mental health matters as much as physical health. Our mission is to spark conversations, offer resources, and connect young people so no one feels alone on their journey.
